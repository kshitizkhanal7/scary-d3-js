# D3.js for people scared of JavaScript

## My Story
As somebody advocating for Open Data using beautiful visualizations created by friends in the community, I always wanted to make some of those playful visualization myself. I was trained as a mechanical engineer, which means that programming is something nice to have, not something I must master. Web programming was whole another domain for me. 


Those luring visualizations created in JavaScript though! Those would tempt and scare me at the same time. I wanted to make those myself, but learning whole new series of languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript was a daunting Everest in my path. 


I learned basics of HTML and CSS through FreeCodeCamp, StackOverflow and other documentations. I have been slowly cracking JavaScript now. When I felt comfortable running few loops without errors in JavaScript, I felt ready to learn D3.js. I have been loosening some nuts and bolts of D3.js. I find D3.js more satisfying than HTML and CSS. I am biased toward beautiful visualizations and I know it! 


Anyway, JavaScript is less scary to me nowadays. One of my friends suggested I start with Let's Make a Bar Chart by Mike Bostock. I couldn't get past few paragraphs. Too technical! Too many new words! I am hunting for simple resources to learn D3.js nowadays. But they have been worth the effort. I can make few charts now.


Now I want to create a resource for people like me. A place that explains how d3.js works and teaches you use it to make interesting visualizations yourself. If any part of my story resonated with you, this repo is probably for you! 

## Your story
Your story and mine go together. I will keep updating tutorials on this repo. You can try those, and suggest improvements. Pull Requests are welcome too.

## About this repo
Relevant concepts of web programming are explained as simply as we can. 
We try making some basic visualizations ourselves. 


Finally, thanks to my friend Saurav Bhattarai for motivating me to create this.
